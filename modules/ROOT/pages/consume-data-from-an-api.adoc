= Consume Data from an API
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

After you build your application, you can start consuming data from the API. Review the following processes to consume data from a SOAP or REST API.

== Consume Data from a SOAP API

To consume data from a SOAP API that does not have its own Anypoint Connector, you can configure the Anypoint Connector for Web Service Consumer (Web Service Consumer Connector). +
Using the information contained in the API’s WSDL file, the connector provides the connection configuration you need for consuming a service from within your Mule application: +

* First, identify the location of the Web service’s WSDL file.
* Then at design time, the connector helps you to configure the parameters by using the metadata retrieved from the WSDL – host, port, address. +

See Web Service Consumer connector for details.

== Consume Data from a REST API

To consume a REST API from within a Mule application, you can configure the Anypoint Connector from HTTP Request (HTTP Request Connector). +

If you connect to the same REST API many times, or work with an API having complex authentication protocols, consider xref:mule-sdk::index.adoc[developing your own Connector using the Mule SDK]. Check whether a connector already exists in https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] for the API you want to connect to. You can search in Exchange through Anypoint Studio's Mule Palette.

The following process focuses on configuring the HTTP Request connector to call the REST API. Understand the basic anatomy of how a Mule application consumes a REST API, the minimum configuration required, consuming examples, configuring dynamic requests, handling HTTP Content-Type and encoding, and working with custom headers and security requirements.


== Basic Anatomy

A Mule application consuming a REST API consists of the following:

* One or more message processors configured to build your request.

* An HTTP request operation configured to call the REST API.

* One or more message processors configured to accept and process the response.

.Consuming REST API Flow Anatomy.
image::mruntime-consume-rest-api-flow.png[Consuming REST API Flow]

You can configure portions of the application that build the request and process the response.

== Minimum Configuration

The REST API you are consuming needs to have a http://raml.org[RAML] file that describes the API. If you reference a RAML file that describes your API, then the HTTP connector proactively presents you with smart suggestions. +

In the RAML file, you can define the following:

* Authentication
* A base URI for configuring the outbound HTTP endpoint
* Scope
+
Based on authentication credentials, the application can limit calls to only GET requests on certain resources, for example, or otherwise limit access to a resource.
+
* Resources
+
You need to configure the path of the resources for the outbound HTTP endpoint.
+
* Methods
+
The default method for the HTTP outbound endpoint is POST, so you need to be aware of what methods are supported for the resource and, if necessary, change this default to the method you need to make a successful call.
+
* Input validation
+
For POST and PUT calls, the API almost always requires that input format, such as JSON and XML match its schema. +

In Mule runtime engine, you can define or configure the following:

* Output format
+
After the HTTP request operation in your flow, you need message processors to accept the response from the API and translate the response into a useable format.
+
* Redirects
+
If the API uses redirects, enable redirects in your HTTP request operation.
+
* Timeout
* Headers for methods
+
POST, PUT, and DELETE requests almost always require headers.
+
* URI and Query Parameters
* Error handling

See xref:connectors::http-connector[HTTP Connector documentation] for more information on how to configure the request operation.


=== Consume REST API Example

The following example consumes the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1[JSONPlaceholder API]. The example only shows the configuration of the HTTP Request connector, and to make it work, you would need to, at minimum, configure a Message Source to trigger a message in the flow and at least one message processor to accept the response. See xref:rest-api-examples.adoc[REST API Examples documentation] for more information.

In this example:

* The API doesn't require authentication.
* The base URL is `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`.
* The API is a mock API for development purposes.
* The sample API requests available in the documentation show that to get information about user with `id=1` the request must be:

----
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1
----

The previous URL uses the following format:

* Protocol: `http`
* API Base URL: `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`
* Resource path: `/users/1`
* Query Parameters: None, in this case.

To implement this call in your Mule application, configure your HTTP Request operation as described in the following section.

=== Configuration Example in Anypoint Studio Visual Editor

. From the Mule Palette in Studio, add an HTTP Request Connector to your application.
. In the HTTP Request Configuration window, write `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` as the *Host*. The default port value is 80, which is the same as this case.
. Click *OK*.

.HTTP Request configuration with Host and Port.
image::mruntime-consume-rest-api-configuration-1.png[HTTP Request configuration with Host and Port]

[start=4]
. In the HTTP Request operation's properties editor > General tab > Request section, add `/users/1` in the *Path* field. +

When you specify the host you set in the global element together with the path to comprise the entire URL you want to reach.

[start=5]
. Select the *Method* you want to use from the drop-down list. This example uses `GET`.
. Save your application.

.HTTP Request GET Method and Path.
image::mruntime-consume-rest-api-configuration-2.png[HTTP Request GET Method and Path]




=== Example in Standalone XML

The example configuration in Standalone XML:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_configuration">
    <http:request-connection host="jsonplaceholder.typicode.com" />
  </http:request-config>

<flow name="basic_tutorialFlow1">

    <...>

    <http:request method="GET" doc:name="Request" config-ref="HTTP_Request_configuration" path="/users/1"/>
</flow>
----

=== Example JSON Response

For this example, the JSON response has the following structure:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 3,
  "title": "fugiat veniam minus",
  "completed": false
}
----

You can transform the data in the advance tab of the HTTP Request operation. You can also define the target variable, which by default is the Payload.

If this API has an associated RAML file, you can reference it in the configuration element of the connector. With that in place, after you select the verb and asset to call, Studio exposes the metadata corresponding to the output. Integration with other elements in a flow is simplified.

== Configure Dynamic Requests with DW Expressions

Most use cases require that the call to the API change dynamically based on some data in the message. You can configure dynamic requests with DataWeave expressions. +

In the previous example, the request was hardcoded in the URL:

----
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1
----

In the following GET request example, the call instructs Mule runtime engine to extract the user id from the payload of the message. The DataWeave expression `#[payload.user_id]` is used.

----
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/#[payload.user_id]
----

=== Configure Dynamic Requests in Anypoint Studio Visual Editor

From the previously configuration, to do this in Anypoint Studio Visual editor, you just modify the path configuration with the desired DataWeave expression. In this case `#['/users/' ++ payload.user_id]`.

.Configure Dynamic Requests with DataWeave expressions in Path field.
image::mruntime-consume-rest-api-configuration-3.png[Configure Dynamic Requests with DataWeave expressions in Path field]

This can also be done for the query or URI parameters, or HTTP method.
Additionally, you can use xref:configuring-properties.adoc[Configuration Properties] to set any of these.

=== Configure Dynamic Requests in Standalone XML

The example configuration of dynamic requests in Standalone XML.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
  <http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_configuration">
    <http:request-connection host="jsonplaceholder.typicode.com" />
  </http:request-config>
  <flow name="basic_tutorialFlow1">
    <...>
    <set-payload value='#[{user_id: "10"}]'/>
    <http:request method="GET" config-ref="HTTP_Request_configuration" path="#['/users/' ++ payload.user_id]"/>
  </flow>
----

== HTTP Content-Type and Encoding

When you send a POST request, Mule runtime engine adheres to the following rules regarding Content-Type and encoding of the body.

=== Sending

[cols="2*"]
|===
|Content |Rules
|*For a String, char[], Reader, or similar* a|
* If the endpoint has explicitly-set encoding, Mule runtime engine uses this encoding.
* If the endpoint does not have explicitly-set encoding, Mule runtime engine determines the encoding from the message property `Content-Type`.
* If the `Content-Type` message property is not set, Mule runtime engine uses the Mule Context default configuration.
* For `Content-Type`, Mule runtime engine sends the message property `Content-Type`, but with the actual encoding set.

|*For binary content* a|
Encoding is not relevant. Mule runtime engine sets `Content-Type` as follows:

* If the `Content-Type` property is set on the message, Mule runtime engine uses the defined content-type.
* If the `Content-Type` property is not set on the message, Mule runtime engine sets "application/octet-stream" as `Content-Type`.

|===

== Custom Headers

Some APIs require that you pass custom headers along with your requests, such as your developer key. Just like with the query parameters, you can also add headers to your request on the HTTP connector. +
For example, if the API you are consuming requires that you register for a developer key, then pass that key as a header on your requests using the header name `accessKey`. +
You can add a property to set custom headers, as describe in the following section.

=== Custom Headers in Anypoint Studio

To set custom headers in Studio, review the following steps:

* In the HTTP Request operation's properties editor select the *Headers* tab.
* Select the Add button. This creates a few new fields that correspond to a new header.
* Define the Header Name and its value. Both can be defined also using expressions or properties placeholders. +

.Configure Custom Headers in the HTTP Request operation's properties editor.

== Security Requirements

If the API you are calling requires working with security requirements, you can configure a global HTTPS connector if your API requires incoming requests via HTTPS, and also set basic authentication credentials.
If you work with complex authentication protocols such as OAuth, you can build your own Connector to consume the API as well.

=== HTTPS Configuration

If the REST API you are consuming requires incoming requests arrive via HTTPS, you can configure a global HTTPS Request connector in your Mule application, then reference the connector in your request operation. +
In the following example, you configure the HTTPS Request connector, create a Java keystore file (JKS) and xref:tls-configuration.adoc[configure TLS].

==== Configure the HTTP Request connector for HTTPS

. In the HTTP Request Configuration window > General tab > Connection Configuration section, for the *Protocol* select *HTTPS* in the drop-down menu.
. Click *OK*.

.Configure HTTPS Request Connector.
image::mruntime-consume-rest-api-configuration-5.png[Configure HTTPS Request connector]

==== Create a Keystore File

Create a keystore file to certify the communication. This can be done using the Java keytool in the bin directory of the Java installation. +

. Using the command line navigate to the Java installation directory on your machine.
. Then execute the following command to create a keystore file:

----
keytool -genkey -alias mule -keyalg RSA -keystore keystore.jks
----
[start=3]
. You are prompted to create two passwords; _remember the passwords_. The command creates a `jks` file in the local directory called `keystore.jks`.
. Place your `keystore.jks` file:
* If you use Studio, place the `keystore.jks` file into the `appname/src/main/resources` directory in Studio Package Explorer.

* If you use a standalone XML in Mule runtime engine, and want to use the file: +

** Across multiple applications, place the file in the `MULE_HOME/conf` directory.
** Just within this application, place the file in the `yourappname/src/main/resources` directory.

[start=5]
. After you create and place the file, you can reference the keystore in a global HTTPS Request connector, which, in turn, is referenced by the HTTP outbound endpoint within your flow.

==== Configure TLS

. In Studio, go to Global Elements view.
. Select *Create* and search for *TLS Context*.
. In Key Store Configuration section, select a type of key store configuration from the drop-down. For example, select JKS (Java Key Store).
+
The default type is JKS (Java Key Store).
+
. Enter the passwords you created when creating your keystore file in *Path*, *Key Password*, and *Password*.
. Click *OK*.
+
If you placed your keystore in the  `appname/src/main/resources` directory, specify the name of the keystore as the value of the path. Otherwise, if the keystore is located in the `MULE_HOME/conf` directory, specify `"/keystore.jks"` as the path.

.Configure TLS.
image::mruntime-consume-rest-api-configuration-6.png[Configure TLS ]

[start=6]
. Go to the HTTP Request configuration window.
. In TLS Configuration, select *Global Reference*, and select the *TLS context* created before. You can also create the TLS context inline.

.Configure TLS in HTTP Request Configuration.

=== Basic Authentication

If the REST API that you are consuming requires that you pass basic authentication credentials, you can provide them within the outbound HTTP endpoint configuration. Learn how you can configure basic authentication in the following section.

==== Basic Authentication in Anypoint Studio

. Go to the HTTP Request configuration window.
. Go to Authentication and select *Basic Authentication*.
. Type your username and password. These can also be set as properties placeholders.
. Click *OK*
