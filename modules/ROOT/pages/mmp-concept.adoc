= Mule Maven Plugin
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

The Mule Maven plugin enables you to integrate the packaging, testing, and deployment of your Mule applications with your Maven lifecycle. With the plugin, you can deploy your Mule application to different deployment targets, such as standalone Mule instances, clustered instances, and CloudHub.

The Mule Maven plugin is compatible with Mule runtime engine(Enterprise Edition) and with Mule Kernel (Community Edition).

== Compatibility

* Mule 4.x
* Anypoint Studio 7.x

== Goals Overview

The Mule Maven plugin has three goals:

* `xref:mmp-concept.adoc#package-goal[package]`
+
Generates the jar file for your project.
* `xref:mmp-concept.adoc#deploy-goal[deploy]`
+
Automatically uploads and starts your application in any of the application deployment targets (CloudHub, Runtime Fabric, or On-Premises).
* `xref:mmp-concept.adoc#undeploy-goal[mule:undeploy]`
+
Automatically removes your application from any of the application deployment targets (CloudHub, Runtime Fabric, or On-Premises).

== Add the Mule Maven Plugin to a Mule Project

To add the Mule Maven plugin, you need to add its maven dependency to the project:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
</plugin>
----

From this repository:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <id>mule-public</id>
    <url>https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases</url>
  </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
----

This enables the Mule Maven plugin in your project.

[IMPORTANT]
Enable extensions. If `<extensions>true</extensions>` is not present, the plugin does not work.

== Mule Application Packaging

The Mule Maven Plugin can package your Mule application into a deployable JAR file that you can later deploy to a running Mule runtime engine. +

The package contains the application and all its dependencies whether those be JAR files required by the application or by its plugins.

Every Mule application has two descriptors. These descriptors tell the plugin how to handle your Mule application's dependencies.

* A `mule-artifact.json` file. +
This file describes how your application is composed. +

* A `pom.xml` file. +
This file describes all the dependencies required by the package to work properly.

=== Package a Mule Application

. Make sure you added the Mule Maven plugin to your `pom.xml` file.
. From the command line in your project's folder, execute the package goal:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn clean package
----

The plugin packages your application and creates the deployable JAR file into the target directory within your project's folder. +

=== Create an Application Package to Import into Anypoint Studio

To generate a JAR file that can be imported into Anypoint Studio, you need to package your application using the `-DattachMuleSources` parameter to include source files and metadata that Studio requires to re-import the deployable file as an open Mule project into your workspace.

From the command line in your project's folder, run:
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn clean package -DattachMuleSources
----

The `-DattachMuleSources` parameter tells the plugin to add a `mule-src` folder inside the `META-INF` directory with an exact copy of your application structure at design time. This option also packages project modules and dependencies required to create a functioning Mule deployable archive file that can be deployed into a Mule runtime engine.

=== Create a Lightweight Package

You can skip bundling the actual modules and external dependencies required to run the Mule application in a Mule runtime engine, and create a lightweight package with only the source files and metadata required to import the JAR package back into Anypoint Studio.

From the command line in your project's folder, run:
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn clean package -DlightweightPackage
----

When you specify this parameter, the plugin creates a lightweight JAR file that does not include any dependencies declared in the Mule application's `pom.xml` file. This JAR file cannot be deployed to a Mule runtime engine, it only offers a way to archive just the Mule application's source files. The result of this Maven parameter is the same as unchecking *Include project modules and dependencies* when exporting the Mule application from Anypoint Studio.

=== Specify Multiple Parameters

You can also combine the parameters together to create a lightweight Mule application package that also includes the source files and metadata to import the package back into Anypoint Studio.

From the command line in your project's folder, run:
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn clean package -DattachMuleSources -DlightweightPackage
----
== Mule Application Structure Reference

At design time, your Mule application must have at least these three basic components:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols=",,"]
|===
| Component | Type | Description
| `src`
| Folder
| The source directory for your application's productive source code and tests. +
See a reference for this folder below.

| `pom.xml`
| Descriptor
| The POM file of your Mule application. +
This file describes all of your application's required dependencies.


| `mule-artifact.json`
| Descriptor
| The mule-artifact file of your Mule application. +
This file describes how your Mule application is composed.

|===

These three components are mandatory. If one is missing, the plugin won't package your project into a deployable JAR file. +
Additionally, the plugin does not consider any other directory or file in the root folder of your Mule application when packaging.


== Source Directory Reference

The `src` directory has two main folders: `main` and `test`. +
The plugin does not consider any other directory inside `src` when packaging the application.

=== src/main

src/main is the root folder for all the productive source code of the application.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols=",,"]
|===
|Folder  | Folder Type | Description

| `src/main/mule`
| source
| The root folder of the Mule configuration files. +
It can contain nested folders, in the way of Java packages.

This folder is mandatory.

| `src/main/resources`
| resource
| It contains the application resources, such as XML, JSON, and properties files. +
Jar files located here are loaded by the application classloader but as plain file resources.
|===

The plugin sends all files inside src/main/mule and src/main/resources to the root directory of your binary package. +
Nested folders within src/main/mule are preserved as directories within the root directory of the binary package.

=== src/test

src/test is the root folder for all the test source code of the application.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols=",,"]
|===
|Folder | Folder Type | Description

| `src/test/java`
| source
| Itâ€™s the root folder of the test classes used to validate the custom Java code of the app. +
It follows the conventions of any normal Java application.

| `src/test/munit`
| source
| It contains the MUnit source code. +
It can contain nested folders in the way of packages.

| `src/test/resources`
| resource
| It contains resources, such as XML, JSON,  and properties files. +
This folder also contains files describing metadata being referenced in the `mule-config.xml`.

|===

== Mule Application Deployment

The Mule Maven plugin allows you to automate the deployment of your Mule application to any of the application deployment targets (CloudHub, Runtime Fabric, or On-Premises). +

By default, this plugin allows you to deploy using five different deployment strategies:

* CloudHub deployment. +
Automate the deployment of your Mule Application to CloudHub.
* Runtime Fabric deployment. +
Deploy your Mule Application to Runtime Fabric.
* Runtime Manager REST API deployment. +
Deploy your Mule Application to your server, or server clusters using the Runtime Manager REST API.
* Mule Agent deployment. +
Deploy your Mule Application using the Mule Agent. +
This deployment strategy only works if all your Mule instances live under the same address space.
* Standalone runtime deployment. +
Deploy to a Mule instance running on your machine.

When deploying an application using the Mule Maven plugin you need to specify a valid deployment configuration in your `pom.xml` file. +
You can set up a deployment configuration using their dedicated deployment references.

== Deploy a Mule Application to CloudHub

=== Prerequisites

* The host and port number of your HTTP Listener flow sources are properly configured. +
+
If you are using the HTTP Listener as sources for your flow, you need to set its host to *0.0.0.0* and its port to *${http.port}*.
+
CloudHub then dynamically allocates a port at deployment time.
+
* All your external classes and resources are properly declared in the `mule-artifact.json` file of your Mule application.
+
Due to Mule 4.x classloading isolation mechanism, all external classes and resources must be explicitly declared in the "exportedPackages" and "exportedResources" fields on the `mule-artifact.json` file before packaging and deploying the app.
+
See xref:how-to-export-resources.adoc[Export Resources] to learn more about working with external resources in your Mule application.

=== Deploying to CloudHub

. Make sure you added the Mule Maven plugin to your `pom.xml` file.
. Inside the `plugin` element, add a configuration for your CloudHub deployment, replacing the placeholder values with your CloudHub information:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <cloudHubDeployment>
      <uri>https://anypoint.mulesoft.com</uri>
      <muleVersion>${app.runtime}</muleVersion>
      <username>${username}</username>
      <password>${password}</password>
      <applicationName>${cloudhub.application.name}</applicationName>

      <properties>
        <key>value</key>
      </properties>
    </cloudHubDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----
+
. From the command line in your project's folder, package the app and execute the deploy goal:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn clean package deploy -DmuleDeploy
----

=== Redeploying to CloudHub

To redeploy the app, run the same command as you did to deploy. +
CloudHub rewrites the app you had deployed.

=== Undeploying from CloudHub

To undeploy an app, run the following command:

[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn mule:undeploy
----

The undeploy command also deletes the app in Mule Maven plugin 3.3.0 and later versions.

== Deploy a Mule Application to Runtime Fabric

=== Prerequisites

* Before deploying an application to Runtime Fabric, check the number of resources required. See xref:runtime-fabric::deploy-resource-allocation.adoc[Resource Allocation on Anypoint Runtime Fabric] for more information.
* The application must be published in Exchange. +
** To do this from Studio, see xref:studio::export-to-exchange-task.adoc[Publishing a Project to Exchange]. +
** To do this using Maven, see xref:exchange::to-publish-assets-maven.adoc[Publish and Deploy Exchange Assets Using Maven].

[NOTE]
Studio allows you to select only two project types when uploading an application to Exchange: `example` and `template`. To specify a different project type, publish your application using Maven.

----
+
. From the command line in your project's folder, package the domain and execute the deploy goal:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn clean package deploy -DmuleDeploy
----

== Encrypting Credentials

Encrypted credentials are available in all platform deployments: CloudHub, Runtime Fabric, and Runtime Manager.
To use encrypted credentials when deploying, you need to set up your Maven master encrypted password and your `settings-security.xml` file.

. Create a master password for your Maven configuration.
+
----
mvn --encrypt-master-password <yourMasterPassword>
----
+
Maven returns your master password encrypted:
+
----
{l9vZ2uM5SdgHy+H12z4pX7LEOZn3Kbnqmt3kIquLjnQ=}
----
+
. Create a `settings-security.xml` file in your ~/.m2 repository and add your encrypted master password.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<settingsSecurity>
  <master>{l9vZ2uM5SdgHy+H12z4pX7LEOZn3Kbnqmt3kIquLjnQ=}</master>
</settingsSecurity>
----
+
. Encrypt your Anypoint platform password:
+
----
mvn --encrypt-password <yourAnypointPlatformPassword>
----
+
Maven returns your Anypoint platform password encrypted:
+
----
{HTWFGH5BG9QmvJ1B=}
----
. Add your encrypted Anypoint Platform password to your `settings.xml` file in the <server> section:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<settings>
 ...
  <servers>
   ...
    <server>
      <id>my.anypoint.credentials</id>
      <username>my.anypoint.username</username>
      <password>{HTWFGH5BG9QmvJ1B=}</password>
    </server>
   ...
  </servers>
 ...
</settings>
----
. In your configuration deployment, reference the credentials injecting the server id configured in your `settings.xml` file.
Below is an example of a CloudHub Deployment using encrypted credentials:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
      <cloudHubDeployment>
          <uri>https://anypoint.mulesoft.com</uri>
          <muleVersion>${app.runtime}</muleVersion>
          <server>my.anypoint.credentials</server>
          <applicationName>${cloudhub.application.name}</applicationName>
          <environment>${environment}</environment>
          <properties>
              <key>value</key>
          </properties>
      </cloudHubDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

NOTE: Make sure that the username and password are not set in the deployment configuration, or they will overwrite the defined server ID.

== Mule Maven Plugin Goals

The Mule Maven plugin has three goals: package, deploy, and undeploy. Each goal accepts parameters that are unique to the desired plugin behavior.

To provide a parameter from the command line, prepend `-D` to the parameter name.

=== Package Goal

This goal generates the application JAR file. The package goal binds by default to the http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.1/maven-core/lifecycles.html[Maven lifecycle phase]: `package`.

Optional Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a"]
|===
|Name | Type | Description
|`onlyMuleSources` | boolean | Generates the application JAR file containing only the source code. This property is just for sharing purposes.
|`attachMuleSources` | boolean | Attaches the source code inside the generated JAR file.
|`lightweightPackage` | boolean | Doesn't generate the repository with all the application dependencies inside the JAR file. This property is just for sharing purposes.
|===

For example, to execute the `package` goal and set the `attachMuleSources` parameter, you run the following command:
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn package -DattachMuleSources
----

=== Deploy Goal

This goal uploads and deploys the application JAR file to any of the application deployment targets. The deploy goal binds by default to the http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.1/maven-core/lifecycles.html[Maven lifecycle phase]: `deploy`.

Optional Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a"]
|===
|Name | Type | Description
|`artifact` | String | Path to the application JAR file to be deployed. By default is set to the application `target` folder.
|`muleDeploy` | boolean | Instructs the plugin to deploy using the deployment strategy defined in the plugin configuration. If the `muleDeploy` parameter is not set, the plugin uploads the artifacts to the repository defined in the `distributionManagement` section of the application's `pom.xml` file.
|===

For example, to execute the `deploy` goal and set the `muleDeploy` parameter, you run the following command:
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn deploy -DmuleDeploy
----

=== Undeploy Goal

This goal removes an application from any of the application deployment targets. It uses the information from the plugin configuration to remove the application from the defined deployment target.

To execute the `undeploy` goal, run the following command:
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn mule:undeploy
----

The undeploy goal also deletes the app in Mule Maven plugin 3.3.0 and later versions.

== Skipping Plugin Execution

You can skip the plugin execution by setting the `skip` parameter to true inside your deployment configuration:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <standaloneDeployment>
      <muleHome>${mule.home.test}</muleHome>
      <skip>true</skip>
    </standaloneDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

== Skipping Deployment Verification

You can skip the status verification of your deployed app by setting the `skipDeploymentVerification` parameter to true inside of any of the platform deployments (Cloudhub, Runtime Manager, and Runtime Fabric):

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <runtimeFabricDeployment>
      ...
      <skipDeploymentVerification>true</skipDeploymentVerification>
      ...
    </runtimeFabricDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

If the `skipDeploymentVerification` parameter is not present, the default value is false. +
This feature is available in plugin version 3.2.5 and later.

== Excluding Files from the Application Package

When you package an application, you can exclude certain files or directories. Create a `_muleExclude` file at the project root directory and edit its content to set the exclusion rules.

Each line in a `_muleExclude` file specifies a rule that follows the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileOps.html#glob[glob pattern].

For example, consider the following `_muleExclude` file which contains two exclusion rules:
----
fileToBeExcluded.json
**/src/main/resources/local_directory
----

* The first line indicates that all files named `fileToBeExcluded.json`, inside any directory, are excluded from the application package. +
* The second line indicates that only the directory named `local_directory` located under `src/main/resources` is excluded from the package. +
If `**/src/main/resources/local_directory` is replaced with `local_directory` then all directories named `local_directory`, inside the project, are excluded from the application package.

== Anypoint Runtime Manager On-Premises TLS Errors

When trying to connect to an instance of Runtime Manager that's on an  xref:1.5@private-cloud::index.adoc[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition] installation, the plugin validates certificates for that server. If you haven't installed the server certificates in your truststore, an SSL error occurs. To avoid this problem, you can run the plugin in an insecure mode, which skips the security validations. You can use the *armInsecure* tag or the *arm.insecure* system property.

[WARNING]
Enabling an insecure connection is a dangerous practice. Don't use this unless you know what you are doing and your On-Premises installation is isolated in a local network.

See the configuration example below:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <armDeployment>
        <target>${target}</target>
        <targetType>${target.type}</targetType>
        <username>${username}</username>
        <password>${password}</password>
        <environment>${environment}</environment>
        <armInsecure>true</armInsecure>
    </armDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----
